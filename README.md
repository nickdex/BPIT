A simple notification app for my college.

I wanted for replace my email notification system by android's push notifications so here's what that lead to :)

<strong>Note</strong>
This app has been discontinued. I may or may not pick it up after some time when I get free from my exams.

Latest Version
0.9.10 (Beta)

Companion Server - https://github.com/nickdex/BpitServer.git


Some tips to for testing
  1. Server is on local machine so unless I'am running it, notification won't be pushed.
  2. For intial beta testing, every message sent from app will broadcast to everyone.
