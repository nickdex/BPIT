A simple notification app for my college
I wanted for replace my email notification system by android's push notifications so here's what I that lead to :)

Latest Version
0.9.10 (Beta)

Some tips to for testing
  1. Server is on local machine so unless I'am running it, notification won't be pushed.
  2. For intial beta testing, every message sent from app will broadcast to everyone.
